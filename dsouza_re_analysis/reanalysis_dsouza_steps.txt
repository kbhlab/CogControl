Reanalysis steps for D'Souza et al. (2020) data.
Feedback and suggestions: dalbenwork@gmail.com

1. Wrangling:

Summary: 
Raw (sample-by-sample) data were extracted from MATLAB and saved on .csv files.
These files were then manipulated in R to produce a single dataset with experimental and demographic data (i.e., "data_full_trials.csv", "dataset_exp1_v3.csv").
The final raw datasets are hosted by D'Souza et al. (2020) at: https://osf.io/53gh2/


1.1. MATLAB:
a) D'Souza et al. recorded data on 3 (independent?) buffers: 1. events, 2. time, 3. samples; 
b) Event buffer had its own timeline; 
c) Time and samples buffers were combined adapting the authors' matlab script;
d) For each participant, one samples file (with a timeline) and one events file (with a timeline) were generated;
e) These files were saved in csv format. E-mail: dalbenwork@gmail.com to access them.

1.2. R:
a) Individual csv files for events and samples were input;
b) `dplyr::left_join` didn't work for joining these dfs as the timelines between them do not exactly match; 
c) `purrr::map2` and `fuzzyjoin::fuzzy_left_join` were used to join csvs based on time interval (~ 14 hours of processing);
d) Unable to identify 10 participants;
e) 18/06/2020: Additional information was provided by Dean D'Souza by e-mail;
f) 19/06/2020: Update participant info, A90 was missing; 
g) A90 was retrieved from MATLAB: 1 file was generated for exp1 and another for exp2 and 3. The file for exp2 and 3 overwrote the file from exp1;
h) Added A90, full 102-infants sample was identified;
i) Two dataframes with experimental and demographic data were generated:
	- "data_full_trials.csv": containing 51 participants included in the final analysis (main article);
	- "dataset_exp1_v3.csv": containing 102 participants included in the additional analysis (supplementary material);

2. Inferential analysis and visualizations:
We adapted the script developed for analysis of Study 1a and Study 2.
