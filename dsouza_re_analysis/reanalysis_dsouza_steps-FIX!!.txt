Reanalysis steps for D'Souza et al. (2020) data.

1. Wrangling:

Summary: 
Raw (sample-by-sample) data was extracted from MATLAB and saved on .csv files.
These files were then amnipulated on R to produce a single dataset with experimental and demographic data. 

1.1. MATLAB:
D'Souza et al. recorded data on 3 (independent?) buffers: 1. events, 2. time, 3. samples; 
Event buffer had its' own timeline; 
Time and samples buffers were combined adpating the authors' matlab script;
For each participant, one samples file (with a timeline) and one events file (with a timeline) was genereted;
This files were saved on csv format.

1.2. R:
Individual csvs files for events and samples were input;
`dplyr::left_join` didn't work for joining these dfs as the timelines between them do not exactly match; 
`purrr::map2` and `fuzzyjoin::fuzzy_left_join` were used to join csvs based on time interval (~ 14 hours of processing);
Unable to identify 10 participants;
18/06/2020: Additional information was provided by Dean D'Souza by e-mail;
19/06/2020: Update participant info, A90 was missing; 
A90 was retrieved from MATLAB: 1 file was generated for exp1 and another for exp2 and 3; they were being overwritten
Added A90, full 102-infants sample was identified;
A single dataframe with experimental and demographic data was generated (this dataset is hosted by...).


2. Inferential analysis and visualizations:

The script developed for analysis of Study 1a and Study 2 was adapted.
