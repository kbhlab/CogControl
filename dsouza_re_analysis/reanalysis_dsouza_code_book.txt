Code book for variables from the raw datasets used to reanalyze data from D'Souza et al. (2020):
	- "data_full_trials.csv": containing 51 participants included in the final analysis (main article);
	- "dataset_exp1_v3.csv": containing 102 participants included in the additional analysis (supplementary material);

These raw datasets are hosted by D'Souza et al. (2020) at: https://osf.io/53gh2/
