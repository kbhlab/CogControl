Code book for variables from the raw datasets used to reanalyze data from D'Souza et al. (2020):
	- "data_full_trials.csv": containing 51 participants included in the final analysis (main article);
	- "dataset_exp1_v3.csv": containing 102 participants included in the additional analysis (supplementary material);

These raw datasets are hosted by D'Souza et al. (2020) at: https://osf.io/53gh2/

- look_direction: factor, left, center, or right according to gaze on x-axis, from MATLAB exp1 analysis script;
- experiment: factor, Experiment1, from MATLAB buffers (events);
- counterbalance: integer, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (counterbalancing visual sequences: AAB, ABB; and reward sides: left or right), determined based on MATLAB buffers (event);
- trial_num: integer, trial number from MATLAB buffers (samples+time);
- event: string, message signaling events (stim3Onset, stim3Offset, stim2Onset, stim2Offset, stim1Onset, stim1Offset, anticipOnset, anticipOffset, rewardOnset, rewardOffset) in the experiment from MATLAB buffers (events);
- exposure: double, predominat language exposure from participants log "RSOS_participants_FINAL.csv";
- age_in_days: integer, age in days from participants log "RSOS_participants_FINAL.csv";
- exclude: logical, TRUE signals exclusion, FALSE signals inclusion, from participants log "RSOS_participants_FINAL.csv";
- ses_score: double, socioeconomic status from participants log "RSOS_participants_FINAL.csv";
- gender: 1 signals female, 0 signals male, from "Laboratory log v2 - a version with fewer indirect identifiers.doc";
- language: factor, Monolingual or Bilingual;
- trial_type: factor, pre-switch or post-switch;
- circle: logical, TRUE if gaze is on center, FALSE if it is not;
- target: logical, TRUE if gaze is on target, FALSE if it is not;
- distractor: logical, TRUE if gaze is on target, FALSE if it is not;
- trackloss: logical, TRUE if gaze is not on left, center, or right side of the screen, FALSE otherwise;
- trial_name: string, concatenation of "trial_type" and "trial_num";
- trial_from_zero: integer, time (ms) starting at 0 for each trial (sampling at 120Hz);
- look_any: logical, TRUE if gaze is on left, center, or right side of the screen, FALSE otherwise (reverse of trackloss);
- trial_unique: string, concatenation of "id", "trial_type", and "trial_num";
- prop_fixations: double, mean of "look_any" for each "trial_unique";
- num_good_trials: integer, number of trials who had "prop_fixations" greater than .5;  
- num_trial_types: integer, number of "trial_types" (pre- and post-switch) with "num_good_trials" greater than 5.
